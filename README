Innostore is a simple Erlang API to Embedded InnoDB.

Innostore does not attempt to provide the same API as Inno itself, but
instead provides a simpler interface which is sufficient for many
uses.  This interface is exported by the "innostore" module of the
"innostore" application.

An example of use of that interface can be found in the
"innostore_riak" module, which is a valid Riak backend module using
innostore for storage.

While InnoDB can be extremely fast for a durable store, the
performance (with or without the innostore API) is highly dependent on
tuning the local configuration to match the local hardware.  Most of
the useful tuning parameters are exposed as application variables in
the innostore app.  Some examples of tuning:
 - keep data_home_dir and log_group_home_dir on separate disks if possible
 - make buffer_pool_size as large as possible but less than available RAM
(There are many other variables which you are likely to want to tune,
but this is not the place for an extensive InnoDB tuning tutorial)
